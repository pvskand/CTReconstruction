5) Hann.m - Hann filter
6) ramp.m - ramp filter
7) shepp_logan.m - shepp logan filter
8) NWFBP.m - noise weighted filter
9) test.m - script to run the experiments.

Instructions to run the files:

1) To run Back Projection algorithms:

reconstructed_img = back_projection(sinogram,angle, f, 'bp')

sinogram - sinogram image
angle - if the angle 0-180 is divided in say x steps then angle = x:x:180
f - filter name [hann, hamming, shepp_logan, ramp, none, NWFBP]


2) To run ART and SART

reconstructed_img = back_projection(sinogram,angle, 'none', 'art') // for ART

reconstructed_img = back_projection(sinogram,angle, 'none', 'sart') // for SART

sinogram - sinogram image
angle - if the angle 0-180 is divided in say x steps then angle = x:x:180
